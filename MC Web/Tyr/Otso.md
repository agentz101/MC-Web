This person is outside the regular law hunts down others.  They are given targets by Sauron, to hunt when Sauron cannot find the evidence to convict them, he sends OTSO after them.

They often end up hunting down [[The Phallanx]] and were sent to hunt [[Britney Stone]], by [[Mother Gothal]] to take down the pre-existing fighting ring, so that Darth Vader could control it.
