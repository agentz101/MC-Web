Is a taxi driver as job, and an independent journalist on the side, and got kicked out of a news agency because she was breaking into a sources house to find information about a potentially illegal deal.  The person in the building shot her and she ran until an ambulance was called.  Crows went to her and were telling her to follow them.

The illegal deal she was investigating was the merger practices of [[Technicolor Conglomerate]], but probably just knows the business name and not the who.
